    <p class="magic-text">
        Hello, dear apprentices. I apologize for not being able to greet you in person, but I am afraid I am rather busy with other matters at the moment.
        As you may have figured out (of which I hope you did, as you are now working in an environment most challenging), these tablets will be the main method of archiving
        and transferring notes, messages, and other written media.
    </p>
    <p class="magic-text">
        Here are a few notes to view and study before I return for your orientation:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="./tablet.html"><p class="magic-text">「tablet」</p></a></li>
            <li><a href="./restrictions.html"><p class="magic-text">tablet</p></a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</body>
